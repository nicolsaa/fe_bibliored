# Active Context

- Current work focus: Aligning codebase with memory bank definitions; ensure domain models exist and map to Android Kotlin artefact structure; plan to document next steps.

- Recent changes: Created core docs: projectbrief.md, productContext.md; updated todo_list.md; updated memory_bank.md.

- Next steps:
  - Create systemPatterns.md and techContext.md
  - Create progress.md
  - Map codebase to memory bank concepts (domain models, DTOs, API, UI, ViewModels)
  - Update activeContext.md with current focus, recent changes, next steps
  - Update progress.md with current status
  - Implement initial alignment changes in code to reflect memory bank architecture (e.g., ensure data models exist)
  - Add unit test skeletons for domain models
  - Build and run the app to verify compilation

- Important patterns and preferences:
  - Data classes for domain models
  - Repositories for data access
  - DTOs mapping
  - MVVM for UI with ViewModels

- Learnings and project insights:
  - Keep memory bank as single source of truth; update after code changes.
