- [x] Read memory bank (memory_bank.md)

- [ ] Identify core files referenced by memory bank and verify their existence; create placeholders if missing

- [ ] Create memory-bank/core directory structure and core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md)

- [ ] Map codebase to memory bank concepts (domain models, DTOs, API, UI, ViewModels)

- [ ] Update activeContext.md with current focus, recent changes, next steps

- [ ] Update progress.md with current status

- [ ] Implement initial alignment changes in code to reflect memory bank architecture (e.g., ensure data models exist)

- [ ] Add unit test skeletons for domain models

- [ ] Build and run the app to verify compilation
